# Getting Started

Marko re-imagines HTML as a language for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces. Nearly any valid HTML is also valid Marko, but Marko extends the HTML language to enable building modern applications in a declarative way.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

Marko's goal is to be easy and accessible for every web developer. Familiarity with the following will help you when developing Marko applications:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Numerous guides and tutorials are available online for learning web development. Marko builds on HTML, so everything you learn about HTML can be applied to Marko. For comprehensive guides, some of our favorites include [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-html-basics/).
