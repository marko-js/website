# Marko Documentation Writing Guidelines

## Voice and Tone

- Use formal, technical tone without being overly academic
- Avoid second person ("you") in main content - use impersonal phrasing instead
  - ❌ "When you create a component..."
  - ✅ "When creating a component..." or "When a component is created..."
- Use "we" in tutorials when building something together
- Be matter-of-fact and precise in reference docs
- Use encouraging but professional language in tutorials ("Aha!", "Great!")

## Headings and Structure

- Keep headings short: 1-3 words maximum
- Never use colons in headings followed by descriptions
- Use clear hierarchical sections (##, ###)
- Headings should be nouns or short phrases, not full sentences

## Documentation Structure by Type

### Reference Documents

- Start with brief description of what the feature/API does
- Use clear hierarchical sections (##, ###)
- Include syntax examples immediately after explanations
- End sections with practical code examples
- Cross-reference related concepts frequently
- Use parameter tables for APIs

### Tutorial Documents

- Include TLDR section with brief summary
- Build complexity step-by-step with working examples
- Use conversational tone with "we" to guide the reader
- Show incremental improvements to the same example
- Include complete, runnable code snippets

### Explanation Documents

- Include TLDR section with 2-4 very brief "at a glance" bullets. Fragments are allowed and usually should not end with periods. Do not include a blank line after the TLDR callout.
- Focus on "why" and conceptual understanding
- Use **bold** and _italics_ sparingly for truly key concepts only
- Provide practical guidance and best practices
- Include real-world examples and use cases
- Maintain a technical but slightly conversational tone

## Code Examples and Technical Content

- Every concept should have a concise, focused code example
- Examples must be minimal and strictly relevant
- Add filenames to code examples with a `/* filename.extension */` on the first line
- Examples must be unique across all documentation - avoid reusing common tropes
- In Marko files, use JS-style comments (`// comment` or `/* comment */`) instead of HTML comments (`<!-- comment -->`)
- Avoid the `**Bold Title**: description` list pattern which sounds LLM-generated
- In surrounding prose, avoid calling examples "minimal" or "simple". Prefer neutral lead-ins such as "Consider this Marko template" or "Example".

## Callouts and Formatting

- Use `> [!TLDR]` for brief summaries (no empty line after)
- Use `> [!NOTE]` sparingly for important clarifications
- Use `> [!TIP]` occasionally for practical advice
- Use `> [!WARNING]` for common mistakes or anti-patterns
- Use `> [!CAUTION]` for critical warnings only
- Use `> [!IMPORTANT]` rarely for notable but less central info
- Use backticks for code elements, file names, and API references
- Use **bold** sparingly for the most important key terms only
- Use _italics_ sparingly for emphasis
- Never use emdash (—); use periods, commas, or restructure sentences instead

## Cross-References and Links

- Link to related concepts in other documents
- Reference specific sections using anchors
- Link to external resources (MDN, etc.) for web standards
- Maintain consistency in how concepts are referenced

## Content Philosophy

- Focus on Marko's strengths and unique features
- Explain benefits without comparing negatively to other frameworks
- Emphasize compile-time intelligence and automatic optimization
- Highlight zero-JS by default and progressive enhancement
- Show how features solve real development problems
